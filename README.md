## Currency Exchange App
This application was built using React and the Bootstrap framework. Using a currency exchange rate API, the Currency Exchange App allows the user to explore exchange rates across 180+ national currencies and cryptocurrencies. Upon entry into the application, the user can view featured exchanges of hand-selected currencies. Alternatively, the user is able to choose their desired base currency.

With a base currency selected, the exchange rates will be displayed against all other currencies. With the ability to search for specific exchanges or order exchanges from high-to-low or low-to-high, the user has significant flexibility in displaying the data that they would like to see. For cryptocurrency or forex traders, the ability to make notes on a specific base currency is a great way to document worthwhile exchanges or to keep an eye on promising trades. These notes persist as favorites for the user to view at any time.
